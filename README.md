## South Korea High-speed Rail Planning | 한국고속철도 교통계획

## Contributors:

## Key Assumptions:
- Gyeongbu and Honam High-speed Lines (경부고속선, 호남고속선) are the main HSR lines operated by KORAIL and KR.
- Section from Seoul to Busan was analyzed since this section is where most passengers board and alight.
- KTX stops for each stop for around 2 minutes.
- Dataset for Tuesday, August 6th 2024 was used from [LetsKorail](https://www.letskorail.com/ebizbf/EbizbfForeign_pr16100.do?gubun=1) website.
- SRT was NOT analyzed since it is NOT operated by KORAIL.
